# ðŸ“š Real Estate Returns by School Zone

This project analyzes real estate total returns by school zone to investigate whether and how school quality impacts investment performance. Returns data is available at the zip code level, and this repository aligns that with publicly available school zone and quality data to estimate school-specific real estate returns.

# ðŸ“ˆ Goal

Understand the relationship between school quality and real estate investment returns by:

Mapping zip-code-level total returns to school zones.
Weighting and aligning returns by school boundary overlaps.
Analyzing patterns across elementary, middle, and high school zones.
Supporting data-driven decisions for homebuyers, investors, and policymakers.
